If you're modifying this in the future, know first off that the code was not designed with easy future use, nor abstraction in general, in mind. I've made it a bit better but it's still messy. Assuming you've got the required directory structure in place (check out the video_folder variable), you'll have to:

1. Change the current year and semester if necessary.
2. Change the variables representing the start of the semester (such as start_week0 and current_date) for this semester.
3. Manually download the latest ChromeDriver and change the driver variable accordingly.
4. Perhaps change / comment out the default variables (e.g. input_user).

While it might be worth it, I feel like it'd be a fair bit of work to refactor this project to be "Good TM", after which you could start adding extra features. Like imagine trying to catch a selenium error and closing chrome if one is encountered, it'd be like a million try/excepts. So yeah, maybe one day. Still it wasn't too hard to get it working again.
