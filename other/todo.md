# To do list

**Note:** This todo list has been migrated to the Issues tab.

- ~Command-line arguments: adding a main function, as well as a way to pass in settings before running the script so that the user does not have to wait for the script to run.~ Mostly dealt with via the settings files.
- Move some of the repeated code into defined functions for more flexibility, reusability of code. This has started with the Lecture class
- ~Let the user save the username and password to a separate file.~
- ~Download progress bar.~
- Combine comma-separated weeks and week ranges so that input such as '1, 3-5' can be handled.
- ~Detect if files did not finish downloading, resume or restart them if needed.~
- ~Allow user to choose download folder.~
- GUI, perhaps Tkinter.
