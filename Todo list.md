# To do list
* Command-line arguments: adding a main function, as well as a way to pass in settings before running the script so that the user does not have to wait for the script to run.
* Move some of the repeated code into defined functions for more flexibility, reusability of code
* Let the user save the username and password to a separate file
* Download progress bar
* Combine comma-separated weeks and week ranges so that input such as '1, 3-5' can be handled
* Detect if files did not finish downloading, resume or restart them if needed
